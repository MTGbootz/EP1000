                   <P>So well, i am doing bridging which the property of when there is a structure that is.
                   At first , For the bridging model, i had an idea where on top of the length of the bridging, i was planning to also test if the height of the model had any impact on the bridging of the model. For this, i did it where the i would test the different lengths of bridging all at the height of 40mm, and then all the bridging at all the same lengths but this time at a height of 80mm. However, if i wanted to fit it into the dimensions of the ultimaker 2+, i had to make it so that the structures that test bridging for the higher heights overlap the structures bridging at lower heights.<br> <img src="3Dprinting/Bridgingpic.png" width=720 height="480"><br>However, this model would not fit within the limitations of the assignment. Therefore, i had made another model, that would fit within those limitations. This one is a smaller model that does not factor in the height of the model, and only factors in the length of the bridging.<br><img src ="3Dprinting/Bridging2.png" width=720 height=480><img src="3Dprinting/Bridging2cura.png"width=720 height=480></P>
                   <h2>Anthony</h2>
                   <p>For this group project, I am working on wall thickness.
                    I have picked a range of values for thickness, ranging from 0.5mm to 3.0mm, to test the lowest limits and by what thickness I should stop at for small models. This was the original design:
                       <br><img src="3Dprinting/Anthony1.jpeg" width="720" height="480"/> <br>
                    However, halfway through I realized that 3.0mm might be too thick, so I had reduced the maximum thickness to 2.0mm. In doing so, I increased the width to 20mm and the length to 30mm to ensure sufficient spacing between each wall.<br>
                       <img src="3Dprinting/Anthony3.jpeg" width=720 height="480"/><br>
                    I have also tested for accuracy of the wall thickness up to 2 decimal points, but I wouldn't know the results until it is printed.

                    I have also tried to test for maximum height possible before failure for 1.0mm. However, I hypothesize that I would not be able to test the limits for this part due to dimensional constraints.<br>
                       <img src="3Dprinting/Anthony2.jpeg"  height="480" width="720"/><br>
                       When I sliced the model, I saw that 0.5mm is still sliceable, so I tried to go for the lowest possible it can go, and found out that it cannot slice at 0.4mm.<br>
                       <img src="3Dprinting/Anthony4.jpeg" height="480" width ="720"/><br>
                       I have also tested the values between  0.4mm to 0.5mm, and 0.41mm is the absolute minimum that we can go before cura is unable to slice it. The final model will have 0.41mm as its minimal wall thickness.
                       <br></p>
                   <h1>Caleb</h1>
                   <p>For my design,I am testing the clearance of the 3D printer.Therefore, my inspiration was toys for ADHD kids, and hence I created a variant of a fidget cube and fidget spinner, for others to curb their ADHD. To test for clearance i adjusted the size of the hole in the ball by increments of 0.1mm from 1 to 1.6 mm. <br>

                   <img src="3Dprinting/Fusion%20top.png" width=720 height 480><br>
                   After exporting the file to the ultimaker cura software, I had begun slicing the object to obtain the timing and how the object would look like during printing. While slicing, i realised that i had still had to create a base for the ring for the balls the object to rest on, hence i used the support function to create the supports only at the base to ensure the stability of the object and not allowing it to fall and crumble.<br><br></p>
