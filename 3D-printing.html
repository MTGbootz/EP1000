                   <p> For 3D printing, we use fusion 360 to draw the Model. Then it has to coverted to a stl file, where it can then be opened in the 3D printing software. For the 3D printing software, we will be using ultimaker cura. We also have to set the 3D printer as the ultimaker 2+. Once that is set, it can start to be spliced. You can also set the other settings like the speed of the 3D printer or the infill for the 3D model. This will all effect the time of the print job which is very important as you will not be able to do the print job if you are not in the lab, or if the lab is closed. You can also choose what material you would like to use, but as the lab only provides , that would be the only material you could currently use in the print.
                    <br><img src="3Dprinting/Sphereinbox.png" width=960 length=540 alt="Sphere in box"/><br> Actually for the settings, you CAN tweak afew, like the infill denisty, whether or not to generate supports, the speed(but not more than 80%). ONce this is done, get the SD card from the 3d Printer, open up curamaker, slice and send the file to the SD card. Place the SD card back, start printing the file and make sure that the first few layers of the print are sticking to the base of the 3d printer. Once this is done, then just let it print for the duration, let it cool for abit when it is done, and VOLIA, your print is done. There is not really much to 3D printing actually, since most of your time will be spent in your #D designing software like fusion or inventor.<br>
                       <h3>3D print assignment</h3>
                       For the 3D printing assignment given to us, we have to form into a team of 4. From here, we each have a different 3D model we have to design that tests the different factor:
                       <oi>
                           <li>Overhang: this tests the amount of sag or if the strucuture will sag if there is no support printed underneath. However is really only applies if this structure is connecting 2 other structures.</li>
                           <li>Clearance: This is the distance objects must be apart from one another to be printed as 2 different objects.</li>
                           <li>Bridging: This is a little like overhang, but instead of the having 2 structure connecting the strucuture that would likely sag, for bridgin, the structure is basically freely hanging, and see around the distance of the strucuture can be before it sags.</li>
                           <li> Infill density: This is the amount of material that is printed in non-hollow structures. So a infill density of lets say 20% will have alot less material and alot more gaps than compared to a infill density of 80%. Another thing that affects infill would be the shape of the infill. </li> 
                       </oi>
