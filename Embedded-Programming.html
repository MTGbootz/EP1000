                   <p>For the embedded programming of this module, we will be using the arduino software for programming of the components. However, the eletrical components of this is also important since we will need it to make the physical product work. We are given a kit that includes</p>

                   <p>On top of this, we are also encouraged to use the software thinkercad, which can be found online to test the circuits that we have built, and in case there might be some problems with the circuit, none of the physical components will be blown or damaged. A nice trick i guess that will definiety come in very useful in the future where there will be alot more componenets connected at a time. You can connect the group port on the arduino to this ground 'line' on the breadboard. This allows all the ports along the ground line to become ground. Simiarly, there is another 'line' of ports that work for power, so u can connect your 5v or 3.33v output along that line, and it will make all the holes along that 'line' into a power output port, making it that 5 or 3.33 volts will be coming out. On top of that, the placement of where you put your pins from your connection is very important.<img src="Arduino/Breadboard.jpg" width=720 length=360><br>Picture of a bread from the front and back<br> The important thing when doing the wiring is basically every pin has to be on a new piece of metal(from the back) or a new row(from the front). This is a MUST for all the pins, even if they were to be from the same component. For lEDs, the longer pin would be the positive pin while the shorter one would be negative. Also for almost all, if not all of components, 5 or 3.33 volts would usually be too high for the electronics, which could cause it to fuse.<img src="Arduino/Simpleboard.png" width=720 length=360><br> This a simple design that invovles just the lighting of a LED using the power from an arduino when it is plugged in, the breadboard as a way to connect everything together and the resistor to preven the fuse. This did not include any programming, so there was not any fancy tricks done by the LED light.<img src="Arduino/Simpleblinking.png" width=720 length=360><br> Using the deafault code given by thinkercad, it enables to the LED light to start blinking. However, a small tweak from the first design had to be changed. As we had defined pinmode 13 as the output of power, that means we had to plug in the LED lights to the port 13 on the arduino board. This is beacause we had programmed for the way the power would come out from port 13, so plugging the LED to any other ports would not have the same programming. Now onto the program. THis is a simple blinking effect given by thinkercad. It sets pinmode 13 as the output under the void setup. This is basically where you declare which pinmode would be the output and which port would be a input. Next to the void loop. This is usually where the main program would be written, and since it is a loop, the program would be looping, doin the same action until either we turn off the power, or reset the arduino. Another way to bypass this is to put a command in the program that tells the arduino to stop or maybe just end the code there. The first line is  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); This basically means that for port 13, send the current thorugh. DigitalWrite is used as it was an output, 'outputting' power to the port. However, if it was to read an input, for example an IR sensor, then at first 13 would need to be declared as a input, then when writing in the void loop, it would be digitalRead instead of digitalWrite. The next line is delay(1000);. This basically tells the arduino to wait 1000ms or 1s. In effect, this just shows as the LED light lighting up for 1s. The next line is   digitalWrite(13, LOW); This is just like the first line, but now instead of output power, the low just tells the arduino NOT to give power. This then shows up as the lED not lighting up. Next would be delay(1000) This is just like the first time, so it shows up as the LED light not lighting up for 1s. The code then repeats as it reaches the end of the codes in the void loop. THis results in a blinking effect, where the LED lights up for 1s then turns off for 1s and then repeating this.
                   <img src="Arduino/HW.png"width=720 length=480><br> This is the assignment given where you had a switch and 3 LEDs. the first click would make the 1st led light up, the second click makes the 2nd led light up, the 3rd click makes the 3rd led light up, the 4th click makes all the led lights up and the 5th click makes all the led not light up. To do this, connected the LEDS to port 13,12 and 8 while the switch is connected port 9. For the programming, i set a variable, swno as an integer and put it as 0. At the start, i started with an if else statement. The if else statement checks if the button is pressed. If it is pressed, then the int swno would stay the same and delay(50) was included to deal with the button bounce. However, of the button is pressed, then the value of swno was increased by 1. After this if else statement, is a another if else statement but instead uses a bunch of if and else if instead. This bunch of else if checks the value of swno. If its 1, then only the 1st LED would light up. If swno was 2, then the 2nd led would light up. If it was 3, then the 3rd led would light up. Then if swno was 4, all the LED would light up. If lastly, if swno was 5, then all of the LED would be turned off, as well as restting the swno 5 to 0.
                   <img src="Arduino/photoresistor.png"width=720 length=480><br> This is a simple build that is where the brightness of the room, or the amount of the light of the room dictates the brightness of the LED. The brightness of the room and the LED is directly proportional is how i programmed this. First, i created an integer that called i. This will be the value of the brightness of the room that is recorded by the photoresistor. Then to use the phtoresistor to record, i would require a analogRead instead of a digitalRead. This is because a photoresitor is only able to read analog signals, which is the brightness of the room. Then, when wanting to output the LED but at different brighnesses, it would require a analogWrite instead of a digitalWrite. This is bacause a digitalWrite can only output HIGH and LOW, which is just the highest brightness of the LED and no light at all respectively. Therefore, in order to have the lED display at many levels of brightness, analogWrite is needed. I assigned i to the value that the photoresistor reads, by using i=analogRead(A0);. Then to transfer that value to the amount of the brightness for the LED, i use analogWrite(8,i). The 8 is because the LEd was connected to the port 8 and the i is the brightness i want of the LED light.<br><img src="Arduino/Photoresistor2.png"width=720 length=480><img src="Arduino/Photoresistor3.png"width=720 length=480><br> In addition to this, a multimeter is also used to see the current that is flowing throught the circuit when the circuit is runnning. However, as we are using a photoresistor, the current that flows through the circuit depends on the brightness of the room. As seen from the picture, the brighter the room, the higher the amount of current will flow through the circuit.</p>
