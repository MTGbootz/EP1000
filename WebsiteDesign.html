            <h1>HTML</h1>
                   <p> We learnt that we had to do web page programming to journal down what we have learnt during the dfab lessons.   In the end, I used brackets to program our html pages. We used videos like <a class="Link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk">this</a>(learn html) and <a class="Link"  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ13lX20FqU">this</a>(Learn more  html) to learn how to do webpage programming on our notepads. However this can easily be adapted to brackets as the mcommands are all basically the same. Furthurmore, with brackets, it allows 'shortcuts' by where you start typing something like {p} then {/p} would automatically show up.(i could not use the <> sign for explaining the paragraph start just now as it was be regestiered as a tag, thus i resorted to {}. Additionally we were thought we could also use mark down, but i did not really see the need to do so as i already had the main structure of the website programmed in CSS and brackets. </p>
                   <h2> Tags used often in brackets(html): </h2>
        For this portion, {} would represent <> as i am not sure how to make tags appear as text in brackets.
                   <oi>
            <li>{p}{/p}(This is to make a new paragraph appear </li>
            <li>{br}{/br}(This is a break that make a new line)</li>
            <li>{ul}{li}{/li}{/ul}<br>(This is used to make a  dotted lists .{ul}{/ul} starts the dotted list and {li}{/li} to make a dotted point)</li>
            <li>{oi}{/oi}{li}{/li}(This is basically the same as the dotted lists but instead this creates a numbered lists.)</li>
            <li>{a href="https://"websitelink"}"what you wamt the link to show up as{/a}<br>(this is gonna be very important as this is the way to add a website to your website which would be very useful when you need to reference to something.)</li>
            <li> {img src="file location of the image/name of the picture" width="the amount of horizontal pixels you want"length="The amount of vertical pixels you want/} <br> This is a way you can add pictures into your website. If the picture is in the same folder as the html file, then the portion where the file location is not neccessary. However is the location of the file is in a folder in the folder that the html file is, then you would need to just write the folder name as the file location. Else you would need to write the location of the file starting from the partition it is in. The name of the picture would be the same regardless of where it is.</li>
                                  </oi>     
                   <h1>CSS</h1>
                   <p>As breifing mentioned before in the HTML portion, CSS is mainly used to give the website structure and eye-candy. But as this did not really impact the content on the page, i did not really pay too much attention to it. I used <a class="Link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE"> this </a> website tp learn about css and it was really all that i used to make this website. However to make CSS work(or the version you are seeing now) it was crucial that i used divisions to seperate the parts of the files. So for example, i would seperate the the website to the navigation bars, the content, the copyright portion and so on. Then i was important to group all the divisions together into one larger division. This way, i was possibel to have spaces at the sides of the website, making it so that i was not word from 1 edge to the other. Similarly, with the smaller divisions, i was possible to shift them around the page, making navigation bar to the left of the contents container, or the copyright division all the way at the bottom of the page. Additionally, with divisions and CSS, I was able to add colour to the words and also the background, as well as changing the font. </p>  
            <h2>Tags used in brackets(CSS):</h2>
             <p>For this portion, {} would represent <> as i am not sure how to make tags appear as text in brackets.</p>
                     <oi>
                <li>#"name of the division you want to edit"("Tags/commands in here)</li>
                <li>width:"number of pixels or auto" and length:"number of pixels or auto"<br>
                    same as that of the HTML</li>
                   </oi>
