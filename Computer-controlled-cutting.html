            <h1>Laser cutting</h1>
                   <p> For laser cutting, we have to use the software coreldraw. To do 3D printing, first we draw the model in fusion 360. Then we save the different sides of the model as its own sketches. From here, there are 2 things that could be done. The first option is the export each of these sketches as its own dxf file, then place it onto corealdraw software individually.
                       <img src="Lasercutting/Sketches-sperate.png" width="720" height="480"/><br> The 2nd method would be after u save the sides as its sketches, then you place all of the sides into a sketch. Then save this sketch with all of the slide as a dxf file. Afterwards, u place this dxf file in coreldraw. <img src="Lasercutting/Sketches-altogether.png" width="720" height="480"/>
                       <img src="Lasercutting/Inkscapesketch.png" width=720 height=480><br> The second method, you would not need to care about the placement of the sides when the file is placed in coreldraw as you already adjusted it in fusion 360. On the other hand, if u use the 1st method, then you would need to adjust the sides in the coreldraw. Next for the laser cutting, you could have either cutting or engraving. Raster and vector can be set for engraving while Vector is set for cutting. Usually for all procudures, both the cutting and the engraving, you have to set the cut as a hairline cut, else unnesscary material might be lost, or even the dimension might become messed up as the laser might make too thick a cut. <br>
