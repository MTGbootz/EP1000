                   <p>The requirement of the project can be found here:<a href="https://rdorville.github.io/EP1000/finalProject/Final%20Project.html">https://rdorville.github.io/EP1000/finalProject/Final%20Project.html</a>. For this project, i plan to make something simple, and compact. So this product will encase all of the electronics in a box and should be safely secured. The box should be large enought to house all of the components like the breadboard and the arduino, as well as the other outputs and inputs electronics, which might be protruding out via cutouts.<br><img src="Project/Projectshelldxf.png"width=720 length=480><img src="Project/Projectshellfusion.png" width=720 length=480><br> This is a version of the project. This box is big enough to fit the breadboard + other electronics. It is also high enough so as to allow for a arduino board to be held by other 3D printed parts. However, as of now, there isnt any holes that would allow for output or input. For this, i add the apporiate cut out holes on the drawing so that when doing the laser cutting, it would also cut out this holes together.(note: has not been done yet, so still add)</p>
                   <h2>Burglar/Intruder Alarm</h2>
                    <p><img src="Project/V1NOTWORK.png" width=720, length=480><br>Still does not work, needa do some tweaking<br>For my general idea, I am thinking of doing something like a intruder/burglar alarm. It will comprise of a Ultrasonic sensor as the input, while using a buzzer(which i can hopefully attain) and LEDs lights as the output. It works by having the a ultrasonic sensor sense an area. If the ultrasonic sensor gets a reading reading that is lower than usual, say 30cm or lower, it could mean that someone has crossed this area, and it could be an intruder. This will cause the LEDs and buzzer that we hooked up to trigger, letting the user know that they have some unwanted guests. On top of this, If it was a false alarm, there would a switch in the circuit that the user could press, and that would reset the alarm.

                   <h3>Requirements</h3>
                   <ul>
                   <li>CADD and/or Digital graphic components (vector/raster):</li>
                    <li>2D cutting and engraving: 2D printed part would be the box in which would house all of the components. For engraving, could be just the labels on the box itself of where the components would be.</li>
                    <li>3D printed part:Could be the standoff/parts that hold the inputs/outputs to the sides of box.</li>
                    <li>Embedded control using a microcontroller with<br>
                        –input(s):Ultrasonic sensor<br>
                        –output(s):LED lights and buzzer</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3>3D printed part</h3>
                   For this part, I was not really sure in what way i could apply this to the final product, so i thought that using as a robust and secure way to hold the electronics to the sides of the box would be good.
                   <h3>Bill of materials</h3>

                       <li>Quite a bit of aryclic material (at least)</li>
                       <li>Quite abit of male to male wires</li>
                       <li>Also quite afew male to female cables.</li>
                       <li>Also alot of resistors.</li>
                       <li>A switch button</li>
                       <li>Something with a sound output(Buzzer hopfully)</li>
